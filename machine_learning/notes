make a object of every layer
since it's a feed forward network

compute the activations for one layer
and then pass it on to the next layer

how you connect the layers
is your weights

the biases are 

the initial layer has
no weights or biases

input_size is either 
manually assigned
or assumed from the 
last layer's size

if the input size is 10,
the node should have
10 addition
